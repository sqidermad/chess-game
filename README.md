## Simple Chess Console Game
Simple Chess Console Game is a project developed for the Data Structure course. The game was built using linked list method and the C++ programming language.

## Description
This project is a console-based chess game where two players take turns moving their pieces on a virtual board. The game follows standard chess rules and includes features such as capturing pieces, castling, and checkmate. The chess board is displayed on the console/terminal.

The source code is written in C++ and is stored in .cpp files.

## How to Run
To run the Simple Chess Console Game, you will need to compile the source code using a C++ compiler. Once compiled, you can execute the resulting binary file to start the game. The game will be displayed on the console/terminal.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank our Data Structure course instructor for giving us the opportunity to work on this project and learn about linked list data structure.
